This example ilustrates thermo-mechanical task using two running servers and a client.

1. Start the server for thermal problem thermalServer.py. It uses an example-wide configuration file ../conf.py and a specific configuration file thermalServerConfig.py. A JobManager Mupif.JobManager@ThermalSolverDemo is started.

2. Start the server for mechanical problem mechanicalServer.py. It uses an example-wide configuration file ../conf.py and a specific configuration file mechanicalServerConfig.py. A JobManager Mupif.JobManager@MechanicalSolverDemo is started.


After starting both servers (which will start both JobManagers), the user can:
1. monitor their status (using tools/jobManStatus.py)
2. run a coupled simulation Demo10.py, which creates inputs files for thermal and mechanical tasks, get temperature field and send it to the mechanical task. Temperature and displacements are recorded to vtk file.
