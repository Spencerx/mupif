This example illustrates two applications running through a VPN connection. No need to create ssh tunnels. Both applications run on mech.fsv.cvut.cz while the scenario script runs on a local machine.

Prerequisites:
You need to set up a VPN connection. There are several ways, our approach uses openvpn client. In such particular case, locate mupif1.ovpn file and run as a root
$ openvpn mupif1.ovpn
which will create VPN connection to mech.fsv.cvut.cz server. Then, all communication runs on a network 172.30.0.6 (client) with 172.30.0.1 (mech.fsv.cvut.cz)

Running:
On a server side (mech.fsv.cvut.cz) run nameserver $python tools/nameserver-VPN.py. Run $python thermalServer.py. Run $python mechanicalServer.py
On a client side run $python Demo14-client.py
