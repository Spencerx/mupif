This example illustrates a workflow consisting of thermo-mechanical simulation chain using JobManager.

It can run locally, on ssh or VPN network, see Config.py. Network behavior is controlled by parameter -m is every script.

The thermalServer.py runs on remote computer (if in network), mechanicalServer.py and steering script Example18.py run on a local computer.
On VPN network, no ssh tunnels are created for JobManager and for a thermalServer since VPN can access ports on a remote server directly.

Prerequisites:
Correct configuration in Config.py.

Local setup:
------------
Run on a single computer:
$python3 tools/nameserver.py
$python3 thermalServer.py
$python3 Example18.py

VPN setup with mech.fsv.cvut.cz server:
-------------------
Set up VPN connection with openvpn client as a root, e.g. $openvpn --config CTU.ovpn
Open the VPN monitor http://mupif.org/openvpn-monitor/

Start the nameserver on mech $python3 nameserver.py -m2
Start thermalServer on mech $python3 thermalServer.py -m2

Start mechanicalServer on local computer $python3 mechanicalServer.py -m2
Run steering script on local computer $python3 Example18.py -m2
