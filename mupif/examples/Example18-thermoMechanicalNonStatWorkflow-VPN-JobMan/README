This example illustrates a workflow consisting of thermo-mechanical simulation chain using JobManager.

It can run locally, on ssh or VPN network, see Config.py. Network behavior is controlled by parameter -m is every script.

The thermalServer.py runs on remote computer, mechanicalServer.py and steering script Example18.py run on a local computer.
On VPN network, no ssh tunnels are created for JobManager and for a thermalServer. VPN can access ports on a remote server directly.

Prerequisites:
Correct configuration in Config.py.

On a server side (such as mech.fsv.cvut.cz) run:
$python3 tools/nameserver.py -m0   (or other -m depending on network configuration)
$python3 thermalServer.py -m0

On a client side run:
$python3 Example18.py -m0
