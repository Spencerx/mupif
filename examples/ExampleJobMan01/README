This example ilustrates simple job manager functionality. 
After starting the server (which will start job manager), the user can:
- monitor its status (using tools/jobManStatus.py)
- run (multiple) instancs of simulation script (test.py) that contacts the jobmanager, 
  allocates a new instance of application and performs some processing.
