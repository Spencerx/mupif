This example ilustrates job manager functionality.

1. Start the server.py. It finds a nameServer on a given IP and port and runs a daemon (usually on a local computer).
The daemon registers JobManager and sends URI to the nameServer.

2. Start (multiple) instances of simulation script test.py. test.py calls JobManager.allocateJob, which calls JobMan2cmd.py with a given port and jobID.




After starting the server (which will start job manager), the user can:
- monitor its status (using tools/jobManStatus.py)
- run (multiple) instancs of simulation script (test.py) that contacts the jobmanager, 
  allocates a new instance of application and performs some processing.
