This example illustrates the top level control script representing a simulation pipeline made of two simle applications. 
The overall simulation is performed in a time loop, where one application provides data for the second application, 
which computes the arithmetical average value of given data.

The main difference to Example01 is that this example uses Pyro communication and thus the client and server parts can be executed on 
different computers. Pyro version 4.15 is required.

To run this distributed example:

1) start pyro name server:
python -m Pyro4.naming -n hostname -p 9090

2) start server script
python Example0server.py

note: the server connects to Pyro name server running at host with ip address 147.32.130.150 by default.

3) run client script
python Example02.client.py

note: the client and server scripts can run on different computers.
