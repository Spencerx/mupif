This example illustrates the top level control script 
representing a simulation pipeline made of two simle applications. 

The overall simulation is performed in a time loop, 
where one application provides data for the second application, 
which computes the arithmetical average value of given data.

The main difference to Example01 is that this example uses Pyro
communication and thus the client and server parts can be executed on 
different computers. 

Prerequisities:
---------------
Python (preferably Python 2.x) interpreter
Pyro module installed. To install Pyro, we reccomend to use pip: 
a tool for installing and managing Python packages:

> pip install Pyro4


To run this distributed example:
--------------------------------
1) start pyro name server by executing nameserver.py

The nameserver will listen on "127.0.0.1" locally, or should be set 
to your public IP adress. Note that in the later case, your firewall has to be configured to accept connections at port 9090.

2) start server script
python server.py

By default, the server will listen on internal ip adress "127.0.0.1". If you want your server to listen on your public IP adress, edit the server.py script by modifying localhost variable. Note that in the later case, your firewall has to be configured to accept connections at port 44382.
Similarly, by default the nameserver is assumed to be accesible at IP adress '127.0.0.1'. To change that, edit the server.py script by modifying nshost variable.

3) run client script
python client.py
By default, the nameserver is assumed to be accesible at IP adress '127.0.0.1'. To change that, edit the client.py script by modifying nshost variable.


note: the client and server scripts can run on different computers.
